<p>My name is Ian C.J. Scott. I&#39;m a Junior majoring in Economics and History and minoring in Political Science, Constitutional Democracy, and Ancient Mediterranean Studies. I&#39;m taking this class as an elective for Economics. I love apple pie and butter pecan ice cream. I have an Xbox Series X and a PC. I built my pc exactly 3 years ago this time in 2020 and I built it primarily to play <a href="https://www.taleworlds.com/en/Games/Bannerlord/">Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord</a> at the time. I now play a massive whole heap of games</p>
<p>I&#39;m a massive <em>Game of Thrones</em> Fan and for my midterm project I wanted to do something fun. So I decided to do a summary of the War of the 5 Kings from the perspective of the Books.</p>
